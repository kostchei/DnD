## Chapter 1: Character Creation

### Character Progression
Characters begin their journey at 1st level and advance in the following manner:
- Automatic level gain per session until 9th level
- Traditional XP-based advancement after 9th level
- Gain one Bastion turn upon attending a session after 5th level

### Character Types
#### Heroes
Non-spellcasting characters who champion the forces of good receive the following benefits:
- Ability scores: Standard buy point with Roll 4d6 (drop lowest) on top
- Equipment: Two heirloom items
- Both items require attunement (maximum of 3 attuned items remains)

#### Spellcasters
All other characters receive:
- Ability scores: Standard buy point with 3d6 on top of 8s 
- Equipment: One heirloom item

#### Heirlooms
- Heirlooms scale to 1/2 proficiency bonus
- Bonus: Additional heirloom item granted for keeping ability scores in original order

*Note: Standard treasure rules apply for random loot drops. Players may craft items using Bastions per normal rules.*

## Chapter 2: World Setting

### The Nature of Magic
In this world, the relationship between common folk and magic is carefully defined:
- Only 1% of the population belongs to an adventuring class
- Of these adventurers, 90% are non-spellcasters
- Spellcasting is analogous to advanced engineering:
  - Products of magic are widely used
  - Few understand its workings
  - Some harbor fear or hatred of magical arts

### Divine Magic & Character Traits
- Divine spellcasting is tied to domain/oath traits
- Uses Pendragon trait system (without penalties)
- "Good" alignment requires more virtues than vices
  - Can be satisfied by a single positive trait
  - Neutral is a balance including no traits

### Campaign Settings
Choose between:
1. **Fresh World**: A completely new setting
2. **Greyhawk**: Traditional established setting

Both options include:
- Local rulers (typically adventurers, sometimes with figureheads)
- Established Bastions
- Legendary monsters with regional effects
- Dungeons (not limited to underground complexes)

## Chapter 3: Campaign Mechanics

### Spellcasting Rules
Vulnerable Casting system:
- Somatic components provoke opportunity attacks
- Constitution saves required when hit while casting
- Failed saves interrupt casting but preserve spell slot
- Weapon arcane focuses grant disadvantage on opportunity attacks
- Bonus/reaction/free action spells also grant disadvantage

#### Point-blank Caster Feat
- Cast ranged spells in melee without disadvantage
- +1 to Charisma, Constitution, or Intelligence
- Immunity to opportunity attacks for bonus/reaction/free action spells

### Death & Recovery
- Character death is a real possibility
- Players may create new characters to rescue fallen companions
- Recovery missions available after TPK (Total Party Kill)

## Chapter 4: Seasonal Themes
Each season focuses on a primary antagonist:

| Theme | Primary Antagonists |
|-------|-------------------|
| Cosmic Horror | Aboleth, Far Realm entities, Mind Flayers, Gith |
| Underdark | Lolth, Drow, spiders |
| Elemental Evil | Zuggtmoy, Tharizdun, fungal threats |
| Celestial Conflict | The Blood War, devils, demons, celestials |
| Draconic Corruption | Tiamat, Ancient Empire, Dragonborn, kobolds |
| Undeath | Vampires, ghouls, Vecna |

- 50% of encounters relate to seasonal theme
- Seasonal plots build toward confrontation with major antagonists

## Chapter 5: Social Contract

### DM Philosophy
- Emphasis on reduced DM dependency
- Potential for DM rotation
- Equal focus on individual character arcs and seasonal plots

### Example Boundaries
Soft limits example (Ashley):
1. **No Divine Control**: Avoid inescapable scenarios
2. **Time Passage**: Handle through player discussion
3. **Violence**: Minimize graphic descriptions
4. **Rule Consistency**: Apply equally to PCs and NPCs
